// a std:: array is a string of words, letter, numbers, things.
// a vector is a changing array that can automantically resize itself when elements are added or removed.
// line 1 through 4 is C++ librarys that we need to use in order for the types to process.
// C++ types consist of bool, char,floats, and ints.
// These types give us the ability to manipulate data, providing the compiler with crucial information to preform operations and 
// manage memory effectively.
// std is a name space for librarys in C++ except for operators new and operator delete. This provides definition for the enitites,
// (fundamental concept that encompasses various elements within a program) and macros (a fragment of code that is given a name and
// replaced by its defined value of code snippet during the preprossing phase before compilation) descrided in the synopsis of C++.
